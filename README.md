# Laravel + Vue.js — Todo App

Practice project: a Todo app with **Laravel** (REST API), **Vue.js** (frontend), **design patterns**, and **containerized deployment** (Docker).

## Repository structure

```
laravel-vue-task-manager/
├── backend/          # Laravel (API)
├── frontend/         # Vue.js (SPA)
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

## How to follow the project

**There is no full sample code here.** You do the implementation; the guide points the way.

- Open **`GUIA_TRABAJO.md`** and work through the phases in order.
- Each phase has: an objective, reflection questions, your tasks, and a checkpoint.
- When you finish a phase or get stuck, you can ask for guidance on that step (without being given the full solution).

## Phases summary

1. **Docker** — Set up Dockerfile(s) and docker-compose for backend, frontend, and database.
2. **Structure** — Create Laravel in `backend/` and Vue in `frontend/` (from inside containers).
3. **Model & API** — Migrations, models, and API routes for tasks.
4. **Patterns** — Repository, Service, Form Request, API Resource (choose and implement).
5. **Frontend** — Consume the API from Vue and list/create/edit tasks.

Start with **Phase 0** in `GUIA_TRABAJO.md`.
